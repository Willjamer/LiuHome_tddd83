            </h2>
            <p className="text-white">
              To get started, you can either browse the listings or search for a
              specific property using the search bar. As a student seeking to
              rent a property, you can find a variety of housing options that
              fit your needs and budget. To ensure this, we've developed unique
              and relevant filters to help you narrow down your search and find
              the perfect place to live and make your visit to liuHome as smooth
              and easy as it needs to be.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-white">
              Once you've found a listing that interests you, you can contact
              the landlord directly through our website. You can send them a
              message to inquire about the property, ask for more information,
              or schedule a viewing. Establishing direct communication between
              users through a platform with minimal involvement from the
              developers, aims to consolidate liuHome as an intermediary. Our
              messaging system is secure and private, ensuring that your
              personal information remains confidential.

              4. List Your Property
            </h2>
            <p className="text-white">
              If you're a landlord looking to rent out your property, you can
              list it on liuHome. To do this, you'll need to have an account and
              provide details about your property, such as location, price, and
              amenities. Once your listing is live, students can view it and
              contact you if they're interested. We aim to make the process of
              listing your property as simple and straightforward as possible,
              ensuring that you can reach a wide audience of potential tenants.
